									<h2>Analytics Progress</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on February 24, 2024</p>
									<p>Hello! I realize this update comes relatively late as life has had me quite busy recently, but I’m back and eager to discuss analytics and give an update on my ongoing projects.</p>
									<p> In terms of analytics, this portfolio website has both Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager enabled and thus has been my entry way into these platforms. While I was broadly familiar with both platforms, I really did not understand the impact and utility these can have and indeed the technical depth with which you can use this data. Nevertheless, my use of these has been admittedly somewhat limited as I only use it to see how many interactions my portfolio gets and they are certainly not enough to do any kind of meaningful analysis… yet!   </p>
									<p> As for my other projects, I have been prioritizing the Python financial analysis one but even this has taken a back seat to other ongoing events in my life so I should hopefully be engaging with this fully come March. As a teaser, I am trying to build a model that will analyze any stock ticker against various measures, produce a model, and forecast X number of steps into the future. However, this is only a broad outline and I am still hashing out the details - for example, I am not sure whether I want to go the comparative approach, using multiple models and forecasts as I have done in the past, or focus on just one model. I am currently leaning towards the former as it will let me explore and play around with some models I might be less familiar with and I always enjoy this challenge.  </p>
									<p> For other updates, I am trying out some courses to get my skillset more rounded off particularly in database management and visualization. We will see what comes of these but I am excited - it feels nice to learn something and have it be immediately applicable to my projects.</p>
									<p> I’ll try keep this more updated going forward!</p>

									<h2>What's new?</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on February 4, 2024</p>
									<p>Hey! So I thought that today I'd like to walk through what I am currently working on as well as what I am planning to do. I have not entirely planned out all my future projects but I do have a general direction I want to go in. </p>
									<p> As for what I am currently doing, I have a few things going on. Firstly, I am still working through the backlog of old projects I have completed in R to make them more presentable. In particular, there is one project that deals with panel data (pooled, fixed effects, and random effects models) while the other is focused on qualitative dependent variable models. I keep opening and closing both of these but I do anticipate getting them done as soon as I have a moment and put my head down to do them.   </p>
									<p> Right now, I'm working on a comparative forecasting analysis of different stock prices in Python. This project is very exciting and does differ quite a bit from the diamond prices project in that I am using different models and integrating a lot of new techniques I haven't used before. I see a lot of potential with this project and the more I work on it, the broader the scope gets so I look forward to playing around with this for the time being.  </p>
									<p> So, what is coming up? I have a few more financial analysis projects in mind in Python before tackling a much larger project... No hints yet because I'll dedicate a whole post to it eventually. Also, once I have this backlog of projects complete I want to create some dashboards to summarize the statistics using Tableau just to showcase some versatility in my skillset. Lots to do, all very exciting! </p>

									<h2>Web Design?</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on January 27, 2024</p>
									<p>Hello again! So, today I wanted to write a little about why I decided to make a portfolio website and give some insight into how the process went for me. </p>
									<p> First and foremost, it's worth mentioning that before setting this up I had no experience with web design (aside from basic HTML) or even using Git for versioning; creating this website has been immensely beneficial in both of those regards. Starting this project, I had heard of GitHub pages and was vaguely aware that it let you host a website with a cool address so the first step I took, as any good researcher will do, was search on Google 'How to make a website with GitHub.' Digging deeper I learned what repositories are, how versioning works, and questioned why I hadn't begun using Git earlier. </p>
									<p> Once I had a gist of what I was doing, I found a nice template (courtesy of html5up.net) and began making gradual edits and committing them to Git frequently. I relied on both ChatGPT and Google Bard for help with coding, particularly with CSS as I am entirely unfamiliar with this language, and changed up the template significantly. Eventually, we ended up with the current iteration! That isn't too say there won't be more changes coming soon, as I do have a few ideas for how to improve thanks to some feedback I received. I'll keep you updated. </p>

									<h2>First Post!</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on January 20, 2024</p>
									<p>Hi! So I have decided to add a little blog section to my portfolio website just to have a space where I can talk about things that are not directly part of any of my previous projects while also providing updates on my ongoing ideas. I already have quite a few topics in mind for what I want to talk about so I'm very excited to share them! I'll try to update this weekly, not only to keep a sense of consistency, but also to help me plan out what I want to be doing and give myself a little structure. See you soon :)</p>

									<h2>IMDb Worst Movies</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Understanding how different variables are related is the foundational goal of any data analysis and it remains true for this project. By firstly understanding the shape of data, and some of the relationships between different variables, we can then begin to model these different aspects and derive an expression that describes what factors most influenced a movies’ placement in IMDb’s 100 Worst Movies list. Furthermore, a secondary goal of this project was to demonstrate not only familiarity with various fundamental statistical techniques, but fluency with them while also applying some more complex methods to create a well-rounded and thoroughly examined piece of data analysis. Therefore, through illustrative visualizations, thorough pre-processing, and model diagnostics, I produced a mathematical expression that describes bad movie rating based on a number of key indicators.

									<h2>Time-Series Price Analysis</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Time-series data is extremely commonplace across any application of data analytics and is particularly powerful for forecasting future values. Nevertheless, there are a multitude of approaches to analyzing this data, each offering different strengths and weaknesses, hence this project aims to compare and statistically evaluate three different models in ascending order of technical complexity. For this use, historical data of diamond and gold prices together with econometric indicators (interest, inflation, federal funds rate) provides a strong foundation for developing a widely applicable model to many other asset prices. Moreover, the use of real world data offers a greater level of complexity and an opportunity to demonstrate a detailed understanding of the analytical tools and techniques necessary to effectively manipulate and model this data. Therefore, by exploring intervariable relationships, transforming and pre-processing the data, developing and forecasting three different models, and continually evaluating performance, I was able to accurately describe and forecast diamond and gold prices with a robust statistical model.

									<h2>Machine Learning Stock Price Forecasting</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									For the full code, please visit: https://github.com/jrgdlc/Python-GBM-Stock-Price-Forecast/blob/main/StGBM.py 
								</p>
								<a href="https://python-gbm-stock-price-forecast.streamlit.app">Click here to try the application</a>
								<p>
									This financial analysis project revolves around the use of a Gradient Boosting Regression model, a form of machine learning. Before going into further detail below, this program works by firstly fetching realtime data then transforming it so that the model is trained to predict future values instead of current values and outputting this forecast in both a table and graph. It is also important to note that any predictions made by the program should not be taken as financial or investment advice.
								</p>
								<p>
									Firstly, let me explain the model being used. Gradient Boosting Regression models are very powerful yet not all too complicated; they work by creating a large number of simple decision trees which make predictions based on the features, or indicators, they are fed. Individually, these decision trees are not very powerful thus the model will go back and evaluate all of them to see which produces the smallest error relative to the training data. It does this through another decision tree, focusing instead on the errors. With each subsequent decision tree produced, the model will try to minimize the size of the error (residuals) and eventually output a model that best fits the training data. For further information, I found this explanation to be very useful: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-gradient-boosting/
								</p>
								<p>
									Gradient Boosting Regression models, as you may infer from the name, are typically used for regressions and thus have limited applicability to time-series data but there are ways around this. Usually with regression models, they take a set of indicators and figure out the relationship to the output and then apply it to a set of indicators they have not yet seen:
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<img src="images/yx1.png" alt="Image Description" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: 240px;">
								</div>
								<p>
									In the above image, the model would be trained on columns 1 through 4 and then predict y for column 5. However, what happens when we do not have the X's for column 5? Well the model cannot predict something without the necessary inputs. Therefore, if we are trying to predict the future, the typical regression approach will not work. So in order to account for this, we will have to add autoregressive effects into the model meaning that we have to consider time.
								</p>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<img src="images/yx2.png" alt="Image Description" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: 200px;">
								</div>
								<p>
									The solution is to, as shown above, shift our y variable to the left. In this case, the model will be trained to use the current indicators to predict the future output. So when we give it today's inputs, it gives us a prediction for tomorrow's output. This is the heart of the problem and was quite challenging to figure out but is a very useful solution when we have a wealth of data and are predicting only a short timespan; generally, the further removed the inputs are from the output, the less reliable our model will be.
								</p>
								<p>
									This project also prioritized user interaction and usability thus all the major inputs into the model are chosen by the user. This is possible due to the Polygon.ai stock API which fetches realtime data for any stock but due to this, I am unable to host the application live as it requires the input of an API key which should not be shared publicly. The only area which the user does not directly affect is the adjustment of hyperparameters. This is an essential part of any machine learning process and it essentially defines how well the model will fit the data so this is all adjusted automatically within the program however, it is also it's biggest bottleneck and slows down the runtime significantly (as is evidenced in the video above).
								</p>
								<p>
									The frontend of this application was developed using the streamlit package in Python, which made development and usability much easier. Again, due to the problem with the API key, I could not deploy it to streamlit to have it hosted there. The repository for this project is public on my GitHub profile so please take time to look through it, use it yourself, and potentially add-on to it! As I stated previously, this method is not optimal however, it is a very interesting use-case for this type of model - if you find anything that can be improved please let me know.
