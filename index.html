									<h2>What's new?</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on February 4, 2024</p>
									<p>Hey! So I thought that today I'd like to walk through what I am currently working on as well as what I am planning to do. I have not entirely planned out all my future projects but I do have a general direction I want to go in. </p>
									<p> As for what I am currently doing, I have a few things going on. Firstly, I am still working through the backlog of old projects I have completed in R to make them more presentable. In particular, there is one project that deals with panel data (pooled, fixed effects, and random effects models) while the other is focused on qualitative dependent variable models. I keep opening and closing both of these but I do anticipate getting them done as soon as I have a moment and put my head down to do them.   </p>
									<p> Right now, I'm working on a comparative forecasting analysis of different stock prices in Python. This project is very exciting and does differ quite a bit from the diamond prices project in that I am using different models and integrating a lot of new techniques I haven't used before. I see a lot of potential with this project and the more I work on it, the broader the scope gets so I look forward to playing around with this for the time being.  </p>
									<p> So, what is coming up? I have a few more financial analysis projects in mind in Python before tackling a much larger project... No hints yet because I'll dedicate a whole post to it eventually. Also, once I have this backlog of projects complete I want to create some dashboards to summarize the statistics using Tableau just to showcase some versatility in my skillset. Lots to do, all very exciting! </p>

									<h2>Web Design?</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on January 27, 2024</p>
									<p>Hello again! So, today I wanted to write a little about why I decided to make a portfolio website and give some insight into how the process went for me. </p>
									<p> First and foremost, it's worth mentioning that before setting this up I had no experience with web design (aside from basic HTML) or even using Git for versioning; creating this website has been immensely beneficial in both of those regards. Starting this project, I had heard of GitHub pages and was vaguely aware that it let you host a website with a cool address so the first step I took, as any good researcher will do, was search on Google 'How to make a website with GitHub.' Digging deeper I learned what repositories are, how versioning works, and questioned why I hadn't begun using Git earlier. </p>
									<p> Once I had a gist of what I was doing, I found a nice template (courtesy of html5up.net) and began making gradual edits and committing them to Git frequently. I relied on both ChatGPT and Google Bard for help with coding, particularly with CSS as I am entirely unfamiliar with this language, and changed up the template significantly. Eventually, we ended up with the current iteration! That isn't too say there won't be more changes coming soon, as I do have a few ideas for how to improve thanks to some feedback I received. I'll keep you updated. </p>

									<h2>First Post!</h2>
									<p class="post-meta">Published on January 20, 2024</p>
									<p>Hi! So I have decided to add a little blog section to my portfolio website just to have a space where I can talk about things that are not directly part of any of my previous projects while also providing updates on my ongoing ideas. I already have quite a few topics in mind for what I want to talk about so I'm very excited to share them! I'll try to update this weekly, not only to keep a sense of consistency, but also to help me plan out what I want to be doing and give myself a little structure. See you soon :)</p>
